# DXNN Spot Instance Deployment

Deploy DXNN neural network training on AWS spot instances with automatic interruption handling. Clean, simple, cost-effective.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup AWS Credentials (One-time)

.\setup-credentials.ps1   # Windows (PowerShell)
./setup-credentials.sh    # Mac/Linux/WSL

### 2. Deploy DXNN Spot Instance

./docker-deploy.sh -c config/dxnn-spot-prod.yml    # Production spot instance

### 3. Monitor Your Training

ssh -i output/your-key.pem ubuntu@PUBLIC_IP        # Connect to instance
sudo tail -f /var/log/spot-watch.log               # Monitor spot interruptions
tmux attach -t trader                              # View DXNN training

### 4. Clean Up When Done

./docker-deploy.sh -x                              # Terminate instances

That's it! 🎉

- **Metadata Tracking** - Full checkpoint metadata with job tracking
- **Single-Shot Protection** - Prevents duplicate interruption handling

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Docker Desktop** - For containerized deployment
- **AWS Account** - With programmatic access and spot instance permissions
- **S3 Bucket** - `dxnn-checkpoints` (created automatically)
- **IAM Role** - `DXNN-Spot-Profile` with S3 access (see IAM-Policy-Spot.md)
- **Mac/Linux Terminal** - For deployment commands

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues
```bash
docker --version                      # Check Docker status
docker info                           # Check Docker info
```

### AWS Issues
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity           # Check credentials
./setup-credentials.sh                # Recreate credentials
```

### Spot Instance Issues
```bash
ssh -i output/your-key.pem ubuntu@PUBLIC_IP        # Connect to instance
sudo systemctl status spot-watch                   # Check spot watcher
sudo tail -f /var/log/spot-watch.log              # View spot logs
sudo cloud-init status                            # Check setup status
```

### S3 Issues
```bash
/usr/local/bin/simple-s3-upload.sh file.txt test/file.txt    # Test S3 upload
aws s3 ls s3://dxnn-checkpoints/dxnn/ --recursive            # List checkpoints
```

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove all AWS resources created by this tool:

```bash
./docker-deploy.sh -x          # Terminate all instances and cleanup
```

⚠️ Warning: This will terminate ALL instances created by AWS-Deployment!

## 🔄 Spot Instance Recovery

**When your spot instance terminates, recovery is automatic:**

```bash
# Just launch a new instance with the same config
./docker-deploy.sh -c config/dxnn-spot-prod.yml
```


**What happens automatically:**
- New instance launches and finds latest checkpoint in S3
- DXNN resumes training from last saved state
- No manual intervention needed

---
**Deployment Note:**

The deployment process now uses a trigger file (`/home/ubuntu/SCRIPTS_READY`) to ensure all required scripts are uploaded before the DXNN application autostarts. The instance waits for this file before launching the training process. This guarantees that all scripts are present and executable, preventing race conditions during setup.

If you modify or add scripts, make sure the deployment process completes the upload and creates the `SCRIPTS_READY` file before expecting the application to start automatically.

---

**Manual verification (optional):**
```bash
./docker-deploy.sh -c config/dxnn-spot-prod.yml
ssh -i output/your-key.pem ubuntu@NEW_IP
ls -la /var/lib/dxnn/checkpoints/          # Check restored files
sudo tail -f /var/log/spot-restore.log     # View restore logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
tmux attach -t trader                      # Monitor resumed training
tmux kill-session -t trader


Detach from tmux: Ctrl+b then d

cat /var/log/dxnn-setup.log

```

## 🎯 Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Setup credentials (one-time)
./setup-credentials.sh

# 2. Deploy production spot instance
./docker-deploy.sh -c config/dxnn-spot-prod.yml

# 3. Monitor training
ssh -i output/your-key.pem ubuntu@PUBLIC_IP
tmux attach -t trader

# 4. If spot terminates, just redeploy
./docker-deploy.sh -c config/dxnn-spot-prod.yml    # Automatically resumes!

# 5. Cleanup when done
./docker-deploy.sh -x
```
